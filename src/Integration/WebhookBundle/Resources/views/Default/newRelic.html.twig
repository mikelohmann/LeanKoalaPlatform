            <h2>How to integrate New Relic</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Go to Alerts</strong> - The alerts section is used to tell NewRelic who or what to inform. We assume that you
                    have already created some alert policies you want to be alerted of. If you haven't please create some.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Notification channels</strong> - A notification channel defines how to inform other systems or persons about occuring
                    Incidents.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 0"><strong>New notification channel - </strong>
                    When creating a new notification channel there are only three fields you have to fill out.
                    <ul style="padding-top: 20px; mrgin-bottom: 0">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Select channel type</strong> - As channel type you have to choose <strong>Webhook</strong>.
                            A webhook is a simple http interface we provide for NewRelic users.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Channel name</strong> - You can choose any channel name you want.
                            We prefer names like <i>Koalamon - www.example.com</i>, but it's up to you.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Base Url</strong> - The webhook for this project (<i>{{ project.name }}</i>) is:
                            <div class="code">{{ url('koalamon_webhook_format', {'format': 'newrelic'}) }}?api_key={{ project.apiKey }}</div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Wait for your first alert</strong> - We're done. Now you can wait for the first alert to occur.</li>

            </ol>
