            <h2>How to integrate Monitis</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Go to Alerts / Contacts</strong> - In Monitis every external integration is defined via a contact.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 0">
                    <strong>New Contact </strong> -
                    Create a new contact.
                    <ul style="padding-top: 20px; mrgin-bottom: 0">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Chose a name</strong> - As Monitis handles a webhook like every other contact you have to choose a name. We
                            would use Koalamon as Last Name, but it's up to you.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Contact type</strong> - You can choose any channel name you want.
                            We prefer names like <i>Koalamon - www.example.com</i>, but it's up to you.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Webhook Url</strong> - The webhook url for this project (<i>{{ project.name }}</i>) is:
                            <div class="code">{{ url('koalamon_webhook_format', {'format': 'monitis'}) }}?api_key={{ project.apiKey }}</div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Request type</strong> - Chose POST as your request type.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Data format</strong> - Our webhooks understand JSON format. So please chose it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Confirm webhook</strong> Normally you now have to confirm your webhook,
                    but this will be automatically done by koalamon.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Wait for your first alert</strong> - We're done. Now you can wait for the first alert to occur.</li>
